This project is a proof of concept designed to confirm the viability of accessing [PostreSQL][1] from [Goliath][2], in a non-blocking fashion.


### Goals Met:

1. Make sure that blocking database operations, like "select pg_sleep(1)", don't interfere with our ability to accept and respond to http requests.

1. Limit, without blocking, the number of database connections we're holding open.

1. Don't crash in a giant ball of fire under minor load.


### Running the demo server

1. Make sure you have postgres running locally

1. Make sure you have ruby 1.9.x and bundler installed

1. Clone the project, bundle, etc.

1. Launch the server
   `$ ./api --port=9000 --verbose`
   `[75693:INFO] 2012-03-15 15:23:06 :: Starting server on 0.0.0.0:9000 in development mode. Watch out for stones`

1. Confirm it's basically working
   `$ time curl -i localhost:9000`
   `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`
   `Content-Type: text/plain`
   `Content-Length: 8`
   `Server: Goliath`
   `Date: Thu, 15 Mar 2012 21:28:12 GMT`
   
   `pg_sleep`
   `real    0m1.025s`
   `user    0m0.002s`
   `sys     0m0.003s`



### Resources:

- [PostgreSQL][1]

- [Goliath][2] -- Rubyists should really spend more time with this project.

- [EM::Synchrony][3] -- Because it makes node.js kids jealous.

- [EM::Postgres][4] -- I was especially glad to run into this project, as it's exactly 
what I was expecting to have to implement on my own.

- [OldMoe][5] -- Dated, but very interesting work on non-blocking database IO. Really highlights the fundamental reasons for pursuing this architecture.

- [StackOverflow][6] -- Because I had the same basic question.
